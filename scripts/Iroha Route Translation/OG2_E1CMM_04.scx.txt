[name]Yui[line] "Somewhere less crowded...? I wonder if there is~?"
[name]Hachiman[line] "If not we'll just go home. Then we wouldn't have to spend more money either."
[name]Yui[line] "You're suddenly so economical? Don't say that, let's just try and find one!"
[name]Hachiman[line] "(... She's right.)"
[name]Hachiman[line] "I don't know if it's less crowded, but I can think of one place though..."
[name]Yui[line] "Eh. Really? Then let's go!"
