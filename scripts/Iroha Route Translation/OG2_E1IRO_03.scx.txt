(Let's rest for a bit.)

"Before our orders came, Ishiki started to open her Lucky Bag."
"Various items were taken out of the bag. I say, is that a 4 dimensional bag? Are you going to take out a pink door soon?"
[name]Hachiman[line] "...I gotta hand it to you, to think you'd still want to buy it after seeing so many people."
[name]Iroha[line] "Heheh, a girl's motivation comes from buying things~"
[name]Iroha[line] "What's senpai's motivation then?"
[name]Hachiman[line] "(Almost, I almost said "my sister".)"
[name]Hachiman[line] "...Let's see. I guess I'd rather be more relaxed? Besides, moving around is such a chore."
[name]Iroha[line] "Is that so? But, didn't you come today anyways?"
[name]Hachiman[line] "...I guess, it's new year's afterall."
[name]Iroha[line] "That's correct. Since it's rare to have a new year's holiday, it'll be a waste not to enjoy it."
[name]Iroha[line] "Let's go out together again next time senpai."
[name]Hachiman[line] "...I'll think about it if I'm free and if we're going somewhere not as crowded."
[name]Iroha[line] "...Senpai, you're always free anyways, we just have to think about where to go~"
[name]Iroha[line] "Then, it's a promise?"
"Ishiki didn't wait for my reply before she excitedlly welcomed the cake that was just delivered."
[name]Hachiman[line] "(If you just look at her enjoying the cake like this, she's actually quite cute.)"
[name]Iroha[line] "This place's cake and Red Tea are really good. How about yours, senpai?"
[name]Hachiman[line] "It's not so sweet so it goes down easily."
[name]Iroha[line] "If senpai says so, it should be okay to invite Hayama-senpai here."
[name]Hachiman[line] "(...She's really putting effort to research for her date.)"
"Looking at her innocent smile, I took the receipt thinking that it's about time to go."
[name]Iroha[line] "Oh, are we going off already?"
[name]Hachiman[line] "Let's not stay here for too long. And it's starting to get crowded already."
[name]Iroha[line] "Yeah, then let's go."
[name]Hachiman[line] "(Um, the meal I ordered was about 1200 yen...)"
"While I was taking my wallet out, Ishiki also took her pink wallet out from her bag."
[name]Iroha[line] "...Ah, this should be enough cash, senpai can you pay for me?"
"Ishiki passed me just enough for her share."
[name]Hachiman[line] "......"
[name]Iroha[line] "...What's wrong?"
[name]Hachiman[line] "...Erm, nothing."
[name]Hachiman[line] "(This girl is pretty serious when it comes to money...)"
"I walked toward the cashier after expressing my slight surprise."
"Isiki was about to exit the cafe before she turned and whispered in my ear."
[name]Iroha[line] "Next time's your treat."
[name]Hachiman[line] "......"
[name]Hachiman[line] "There's a next time...?"
[name]Iroha[line] "What's that? You look like you don't like the idea."
"Looking at Ishiki stepping cheerily away, I couldn't help but smile."
